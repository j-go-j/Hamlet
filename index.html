 <p class="homepage">The development of astrology has taken place over thousands of years.  In ancient times, knowledge of the planets, the stars, the sun, and the moon was based on observation.  In the second half of the 17th century, as humans' abilities and tools advanced, the science of astronomy became increasingly distinct from astrology.  The roots of astronomy are planted in astrology.</p>
 <p class="homepage">The beginning of humans' consciousness of the sky is complex and not completely understood.  Stonehenge, which we now believe dates back to 5,000 B.C., shows an exact understanding of moon-rise and moon-set.  We do not yet know how the ancient peoples who constructed Stonehenge could understand the precise movements of the moon in the sky.  What tools might they have used?  Stonehenge works as an eclipse calculator which means the people who built it understood the 18.6 year cycle of the moon's orbit in relation to the sun and the earth and they could predict with great accuracy the eclipses of the sun by the moon.</p>

 <p class="heading-style">Great Pyramids of Egypt</p>
 <p class="homepage">The Great Pyramids of Egypt (2,500 B.C.) show a precise alignment to the belt of Orion and the star Sirius.  The Egyptians believed the Pharoah was a god.  They identified him with the star, Orion.  From Egypt, concepts of astrology may have moved to Mesopotamia where astrology became associated with divination. To the Mesopotamians, divination was not a forecast of a predetermined future, but rather a consultation with the gods.</p>
