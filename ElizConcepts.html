    <p>Barnardo speaks the quote below to Horatio and Marcellus in act I, scene 1.  He says that just the prior night, as he and Marcellus were on guard duty, an apparition "in the image" of the deceased king (Hamlet Senior) suddenly appeared before them.  The ghost appeared at the same time the night before, and we see that Barnardo marks the time by referencing the path of the star in the sky.  He also refers to the path of the star using the personal pronoun "his" in line 44.</p>

    <p>The Elizabethan concept of the universe and humans’ place in it comes from the philosophies and writings of the ancient Greeks.  Scholars from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century studied Greek philosophy avidly.  They were aware of the Ptolemaic world view which held that the Earth was the center of the universe and the celestial bodies orbited the earth, while the fixed stars, comprising the constellations, were motionless.  This was the predominant concept of the cosmos in many ancient civiliazations from the Sumerians to the Babylonians.</p>
