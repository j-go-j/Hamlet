<p>The lines above are spoken by Horatio.  Take a moment to appreciate the hyperbolic language he uses:  Horatio has a flair for drama, but he is also extremely concerned about this mysterious ghost that has begun to appear.  In the lines above, he is describing the scene in Rome before the fall of Julius Caesar.  According to what Horatio has heard, before the assassination of Julius Caesar, the bodies of dead Romans arose from their graves to walk the streets, the skies were alight with fire and blood, and the moon was "sick almost to doomsday with eclipse".  The planets, stars, and sky reflect the disasters of the earth.</p><p>Before Horatio speaks these lines, the three guardsmen speculate about the motive of the ghost, Hamlet Senior.  What could he possibly want?  They are scared and they  believe (mistakenly, as we find out later in the play) the ghost's appearance has something to do with the recent war.  Horatio's country (Denmark) has recently been at war with Norway, and Hamlet Senior killed the leader of Norway, Fortinbras.  Fortinbras' son, they hear, is now raising an army to take back the land that was lost to Denmark.  Horatio seems to be noting comparisons between the fall of Rome and the war between Denmark and Norway.  In both situations, the dead walk the earth.  The appearance of the ghost of Hamlet Senior is extremely serious business.  Right after Horatio speaks these lines, the ghost appears to Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.</p><p>Also, of note, according to Asimov in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimov%27s_Guide_to_Shakespeare"><em>Asimov’s Guide to Shakespeare,</em></a> the “moist star” is the moon.  Although at the time Shakespeare wrote the play, the Elizabethans could distinguish stars from planets, the play is set in the late Anglo-Saxon period, before 1066.  It’s possible that Shakespeare thought the people of Anglo-Saxon Britain referred to any heavenly object as “star.”  Most important to understand is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(mythology)" target="_blank">“Neptune”</a> in these lines refers to the god of fresh water and the sea in Roman religion.  The planet we refer to as Neptune was not discovered until 1846.</p>
