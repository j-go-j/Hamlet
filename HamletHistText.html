    <h1>Notes on the History of Shakespeare's text of <em>Hamlet</em></h1>
    <p><em>Hamlet</em>, written by William Shakespeare in the early 17th century, is one of the most enduring pieces of literature in the Western canon.  Its history is very complex.  At its heart, it is a revenge play.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Shakespeare">Riverside Shakespeare</a> notes that plays in which revenge is the focus of the plot became fashionable around 1599.  Most Shakespeare scholars accept that Hamlet was written between 1599 and 1601. As with most of Shakespeareâ€™s plays, Hamlet is based on earlier stories and texts.  Riverside Shakespeare mentions a play also titled Hamlet by Kyd possibly written in the mid to late 16th century.</p>

   <p>Shakespeare's play dates to a time in which western society was on the brink of the first major scientific revolution of human history.  This revolution, beginning around 1620, gradually but completely changed western society's understanding of nature and science over the next two centuries.  The Age of Reason, beginning around 1715, was contained within this revolution.</p>
   <p>For a man like Shakespeare who was so curious about human life and the context in which we all exist, this time must have been extremely stimulating and rife with possibilities of new discoveries.  Shakespeare was eminently engaged with life and living and he must have been aware of new advances in science and philosophy.</p>
