    <h1>Notes on the History of Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em></h1>
    <p><em>Hamlet</em>, written by William Shakespeare in the early 17th century, is one of the most enduring pieces of literature in the Western canon.  Its history is very complex.  At its heart, it is a revenge play.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Shakespeare">Riverside Shakespeare</a> notes that plays in which revenge is the focus of the plot became fashionable around 1599.  Most Shakespeare scholars accept that Hamlet was written between 1599 and 1601. As with most of Shakespeareâ€™s plays, Hamlet is based on earlier stories and texts.  Riverside Shakespeare mentions a play also titled Hamlet by Kyd possibly written in the mid to late 16th century.</p>

   <p>Shakespeare wrote Hamlet during a historical time in which western society was on the brink of the first major scientific revolution of human history.  This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_revolution" target="_blank">revolution</a>, beginning near the late 16th century, gradually but completely changed western society's understanding of nature and science over the next two centuries.</p>
   <p>Shakespeare would likely have been aware of advancements in scientific thought. Especially relevant to our subject is the publication of Copernicus' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism" target="_blank"><em>On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</a></em> in 1543, about twenty-one years before Shakespeare's birth.  The idea that the Sun was the center of the universe, although it had been posed before by Greek philosophers, was a hugely significant departure in Shakespeare's time from the prevalent idea that the Earth was at the universe's center.</p>

   <p>For a man like Shakespeare who was so curious about human life and the context in which we all exist, this time must have been extremely stimulating and rife with possibilities of new discoveries.  Shakespeare was eminently engaged with life and living and he must have been aware of new advances in science and philosophy.</p>
